Project Weave builds a framework for applying machine learning techniques and architectures to multi-relational data. Modules and scripts to 'weave'/ store the data and its inter-relations within a knowledge base, to construct and visualise a knowledge graph, and to generate knowledge graph embeddings â€“utilising state of the art graph convolutional network models are provided in this repository.
